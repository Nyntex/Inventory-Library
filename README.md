# Inventory-Library
 This is a c++ static link library meant to be an easy and accessible game inventory that users can implement in their games. It handles the creation of items as well as how to add, remove, sort, filter and move around these items in the inventory.<br><br>
 This library is composed of two header files, "Inventory.h" and "BaseItem.h". For a full explanation of how to include this library in a new C++ project as well as in an Unreal Engine module, [here is the wiki](https://github.com/Nyntex/Inventory-Library/wiki).
The Wiki also contains all information about all members and methods of both classes for reference + an explanation what they do or what they are for, if you don't want to look through the code.
