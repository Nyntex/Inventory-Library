# Inventory-Library
 This is a c++ static link library meant to be an easy and accessible game inventory that users can implement in their games. It handles the creation of items as well as how to add, remove, sort, filter and move around these items in the inventory.<br><br>
 This library is composed of two header files, "Inventory.h" and "BaseItem.h". For a full explanation of how to include this library in a new C++ project as well as in an Unreal Engine module, [here is the wiki](https://github.com/Nyntex/Inventory-Library/wiki).
The Wiki also contains all information about all members and methods of both classes for reference + an explanation what they do or what they are for, if you don't want to look through the code.

## Example project in Unreal Engine 5
Here we have a small Project that implements the library and uses it to create unreal classes which then get used to show both the creation and usage of the inventory and it's items. You can find and download the project not here on Github but [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ymyf6lmwhepnoly/UE_DemoInventory_Projekt.zip/file). <br><br>

For reference on how to implement this library into another C++ project, look [here](https://github.com/Nyntex/Inventory-Library/wiki/Implementation-in-default-Cpp%E2%80%90Project) and if you want to implement it into the Unreal Engine you can look [here](https://github.com/Nyntex/Inventory-Library/wiki/Implementation-in-Unreal-Engine-Module).
